Software Engineering is a field with cognitive complexity built in, even just at the core of the job,
it includes parsing the stakeholder/product owner requirements, writing code for that, which covers off the edge cases,
all while negotiating a codebase that likely has its fair share of technical debt, then writing tests that cover all possible edge cases,
all this while considering security, backwards compatibility, and the performance of the code. All of that is before things
like code reviews, QA, change approval process, and scrum ceremonies, and context switching and the other core parts of most
corporate roles come into play. So its of no massive surprise that so many software engineers burnout and turn to farming instead.

All of this is called **cognitive load**, and unburdening development teams of it is one of the most effective steps towards
a good Developer Experience (DevEx) one can take. Whether it be removing a clunky and unnecessary process, updating outdated tooling,
removing or documenting cryptic error messages, or even making sure TPS reports don't need filling out for the fourth time because
someone forgot to attach the new cover sheet, [that'd be great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsLUidiYm0w).

Streamlining processes, simplifying and standardising tooling, and fostering a cross-functional cross-collaborative culture
while minimizing distractions from those meetings that definitely could have been emails, it allows engineers to do what
they are best at, writing quality code. But before we can tackle cognitive load and move towards this utopian world, we
firstly need to understand what cognitive load is.
